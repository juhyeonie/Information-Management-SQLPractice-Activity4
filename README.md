# SQL Practice – Demon Slayer Dataset

This repository contains **20 SQL practice problems** based on a custom dataset inspired by **Demon Slayer characters**.

📝 **Note:** This project is part of my personal practice for **Activity 4** from our *Information Management* course.

The exercises cover:
- ✅ Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- ✅ GROUP BY + HAVING
- ✅ Subqueries (single-row & multi-row)
